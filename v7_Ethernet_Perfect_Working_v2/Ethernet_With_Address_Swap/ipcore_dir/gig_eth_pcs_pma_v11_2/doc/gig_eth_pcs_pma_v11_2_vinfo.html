4. RESOLVED ISSUES

  1&gt; Updating of Transceivers

  Description: Updated the GTX for the V7 and K7 families with GTX 
  generated from 7 Series FPGA Transceiver Wizard v1.6

  AR: 42672


  2&gt; Updating of Constraints for S6 familiy

  Description: Updated the TBI setup and hold analysis constraints for the
  Spartan-6 family to enable ISE to correctly report the static timing 
  results.

  CR: 631898
  AR: 36961


  3&gt; Updating CPLLREFCLKSEL

  Description: Updated CPLLREFCLKSEL from "000" to "001" to select
  GTREFCLK0.

  CR: 589773
  AR: 42842


  4&gt; Un-LOCed pins in the core
  
  Description: This issue was seen starting 13.2 software on any pin that
  was not assigned a location. Resolution involves adding 
  "-g UnconstrainedPins:Allow" switch to Bitgen to ignore this error.

  CR: 634745
  AR: 43058


  5&gt; GMII_RX_ER not asserted on cable pull out

  Description: GMII_RX_ER is now asserted is continues stream of not in 
  tables and disparity errors are seen, GMII_RX_DV then goes low with GMII_ER.

  CR: 617653
  AR: 43421

  
  6&gt; 7 Series GTX Transceivers - Reset Requirements Upon Configuration
  
  Description: CPLLRESET is generated after a minimum duration of 500ns.
